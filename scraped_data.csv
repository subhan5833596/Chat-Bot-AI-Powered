کرنا ایک لبھاؤنا خیال ہے، لیکن اس بات کا تعین کرنا اہم ہے کہ آپ Google سروسز کا استعمال کرتے ہوئے کیا امید کر سکتے ہیں، اور یہ کہ ہم آپ سے کیا امید کرتے ہیں۔ سروس کی یہ شرائط Google کے کاروبار کے طریقے ، ہماری کمپنی پر لاگو ہونے والے قوانین اور کچھ ایسی چیزوں کی عکاسی کرتی ہیں جنہیں ہم ہمیشہ سچ مانتے ہیں ۔ اس کے نتیجے میں، سروس کی یہ شرائط Google کے ساتھ آپ کے تعلق کو واضح کرنے میں مدد کرتی ہیں جب آپ ہماری سروسز کے ساتھ تعامل کرتے ہیں۔ مثال کے طور پر، ان شرائط میں درج ذیل ہیڈنگز شامل ہیں: آپ ہم سے کیا امید کر سکتے ہیں ، یہ اس بات کی وضاحت کرتا ہے کہ ہم اپنی سروسز کیسے فراہم اور ڈیولپ کرتے ہیں ہم آپ سے کیا توقع کرتے ہیں ، جو ہماری سروسز کو استعمال کرنے کے لیے کچھ اصول طے کرتا ہے Google سروسز میں مواد ، جو آپ کو ہماری سروسز میں پائے جانے والے مواد کے حقوق املاک دانش کی وضاحت کرتا ہے — چاہے وہ مواد آپ کا، Google کا یا دوسروں کا ہو۔ مسائل یا اختلاف رائے کی صورت میں جو آپ کے دوسرے قانونی حقوق کی وضاحت کرتا ہے اور یہ بتاتا ہے کہ اگر کوئی ان شرائط کی خلاف ورزی کرتا ہے تو کیا توقع کریں ان شرائط کو سمجھنا اہم ہے کیونکہ ہماری سروسز تک رسائی کر کے یا ان کا استعمال کر کے آپ ان شرائط سے اتفاق کر رہے ہیں۔ ان شرائط کے علاوہ، ہم رازداری کی پالیسی بھی شائع کرتے ہیں۔ حالانکہ یہ ان شرائط کا حصہ نہیں ہے، لیکن ہم اس بات کو بہتر طور پر سمجھنے کیلئے آپ کو اسے پڑھنے کی ترغیب دیتے ہیں کہ آپ اپنی معلومات کو کیسے اپ ڈیٹ، نظم، برآمد اور حذف کر سکتے ہیں ۔ شرائط سروس کا فراہم کنندہ مندرجہ ذیل کمپنی Google کی سروسز فراہم کرتی ہے، اور آپ اس کے ساتھ معاہدہ کر رہے ہیں: Google LLC ریاست ڈیلاویئر، امریکہ کے قوانین کے تحت تشکیل کردہ اور امریکی قوانین کے تحت چلنے والی ‎1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California 94043 امریکہ عمر کے تقاضے اگر آپ کی عمر Google اکاؤنٹ کا نظم کرنے کے لیے مطلوبہ عمر سے کم ہے تو آپ کو Google اکاؤنٹ استعمال کرنے کے لیے اپنے والدین یا قانونی سرپرست کی اجازت ہونی چاہیے۔ براہ کرم اپنے والدین یا قانونی سرپرست سے یہ شرائط ملاحظہ کرنے کو کہیں۔ اگر آپ والدین یا قانونی سرپرست ہیں، اور آپ اپنے بچے کو سروسز استعمال کرنے کی اجازت دیتے ہیں تو یہ شرائط آپ پر لاگو ہوتی ہیں اور آپ سروسز پر اپنے بچے کی سرگرمی کے ذمہ دار ہیں۔ Google کی کچھ سروسز میں اضافی عمر کے تقاضے ہوتے ہیں جیسا کہ اس کی سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط اور پالیسیوں میں بیان کیا گیا ہے۔ مواد تعارف Google کے ساتھ آپ کا تعلق Google کی سروسز کا استعمال Google سروسز میں موجود مواد Google سروسز میں سافٹ ویئر مسائل یا اختلاف رائے کی صورت میں ان شرائط کے بارے میں Google کے ساتھ آپ کا تعلق یہ شرائط آپ اور Google کے مابین تعلقات کو واضح کرنے میں مدد کرتی ہیں۔ جب ہم ""Google""، ""ہم""، ""ہمیں"" اور ""ہمارا"" کی بات کرتے ہیں تو ہمارا مطلب Google LLC اور اس کے الحاق یافتگان ہوتا ہے۔ سادہ الفاظ میں، اگر آپ ان شرائط پر عمل کرنے پر راضی ہو جاتے ہیں تو ہم آپ کو اپنی سروسز تک رسائی اور ان کا استعمال کرنے کی اجازت دیتے ہیں، جو Google کا کاروبار کیسے چلتا ہے اور ہم پیسہ کیسے کماتے ہیں کی عکاسی کرتی ہیں۔ آپ ہم سے کیا امید کر سکتے ہیں مفید سروسز کی ایک وسیع رینج فراہم کریں ہم سروسز کی ایک وسیع رینج فراہم کرتے ہیں جو ان شرائط کے ساتھ مشروط ہیں، جن میں شامل ہیں: ایپس اور سائٹس (جیسے تلاش اور Maps) پلیٹ فارمز (جیسے Google Shopping) انٹیگریٹڈ سروسز (جیسے، دیگر کمپنیوں کی ایپس یا سائٹس میں سرایت کردہ Maps) آلات (جیسے Google Nest اور Pixel) ان میں سے کئی سروسز میں ایسا مواد بھی شامل ہے جسے آپ اسٹریم کر سکتے ہیں یا اس کے ساتھ تعامل کر سکتے ہیں ہماری سروسز کو ایک ساتھ کام کرنے کے لیے تیار کیا گیا ہے، جس سے آپ کو ایک سرگرمی سے دوسری میں منتقل ہونا آسان ہو جاتا ہے۔ مثال کے طور پر، اگر آپ کے کیلنڈر ایونٹ میں کوئی پتہ شامل ہے، تو آپ اس پتے پر کلک کر سکتے ہیں اور Maps آپ کو دکھا سکتا ہے کہ وہاں کیسے پہنچنا ہے۔ Googleسروسز کو ڈویلپ کریں، بہتر بنائیں اور اپ ڈیٹ کریں ہم اپنی سروسز کو بہتر بنانے کے لیے مسلسل نئی ٹیکنالوجیز اور خصوصیات تیار کر رہے ہیں۔ مثال کے طور پر، ہم آپ کو بیک وقت ترجمے فراہم کرنے اور سپام اور میلوئیر کا بہتر طور پر پتہ لگانے اور انہیں مسدود کرنے کیلئے مصنوعی ذہانت اور مشین لرننگ استعمال کرتے ہیں۔ اس مسلسل بہتری کے حصے کے طور پر، ہم کبھی کبھی خصوصیات اور فعالیتوں کو شامل کرتے یا ہٹاتے ہیں، اپنی سروس کی حدود میں اضافہ یا کمی کرتے ہیں، اور نئی سروسز کی پیشکش کو شروع کرتے ہیں یا پرانی سروس کی پیشکش کو روکتے ہیں۔ ایسے معاملات میں جہاں سروس کو ڈاؤن لوڈ کے قابل یا پیشگی لوڈ کردہ سافٹ ویئر کی ضرورت ہوتی ہے یا اس میں شامل ہوتا ہے تو وہ سافٹ ویئر کبھی کبھار نیا ورژن یا خصوصیت دستیاب ہونے کی صورت میں آپ کے آلے پر خود بخود اپ ڈیٹ ہو جاتا ہے۔ کچھ سروسز آپ کو خود بخود اپ ڈیٹ کی ترتیبات کو ایڈجسٹ کرنے دیتی ہیں۔ اگر ہم ایسی اہم تبدیلیاں کرتے ہیں جو ہماری سروسز کے آپ کے استعمال پر منفی اثر ڈالتی ہیں یا اگر ہم کسی سروس کی پیشکش کو بند کر دیتے ہیں تو ہم آپ کو معقول پیشگی اطلاع دیں گے، سوائے ہنگامی صورت حال میں جیسے کہ بیجا استعمال سے بچاؤ، قانونی تقاضوں کا جواب دینا یا سیکیورٹی اور کام کرنے سے متعلق مسائل کو حل کرنا۔ ہم آپ کو آپ کا مواد آپ کے Google اکاؤنٹ سے Google Takeout کا استعمال کرتے ہوئے برآمد کرنے کی اجازت دیں گے، قابل اطلاق قانون اور پالیسیوں سے مشروط ہے۔ ہم آپ سے کیا توقع کرتے ہیں ان شرائط اور سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط کی پیروی کریں ہم آپ کو اپنی سروسز استعمال کرنے کی اجازت اس وقت تک دیتے ہیں جب تک آپ ان شرائط کی تعمیل کرتے ہیں: سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط جس میں مثال کے طور پر، عمر کے اضافی تقاضوں جیسی چیزیں شامل ہو سکتی ہیں ہم عام سوالوں کے جوابات دینے اور اپنی سروسز کے استعمال کی توقعات متعین کرنے کے لیے مختلف پالیسیاں، ہیلپ سینٹرز اور دیگر وسائل بھی دستیاب کرتے ہیں۔ ان وسائل میں ہماری رازداری کی پالیسی ، کاپی رائٹ ہیلپ سینٹر ، حفاظتی مرکز ، شفافیت کے مرکز اور ہماری پالیسیوں کی سائٹ پر دستیاب دیگر قابل رسائی صفحات شامل ہیں۔ بالآخر، ہم اپنی سروسز کے اندر مخصوص ہدایات اور وارننگز فراہم کر سکتے ہیں، جیسے آپ کو اہم معلومات سے متعلق الرٹ کرنے والے ڈائلاگ باکسز۔ حالانکہ ہم آپ کو اپنی سروسز استعمال کرنے کی اجازت دیتے ہیں، لیکن ہم سروسز میں موجود کسی بھی حق املاک دانش کو برقرار رکھتے ہیں۔ دوسروں کا احترام کریں ہم ہر کسی کیلئے احترام پر مبنی ماحول قائم کرنا چاہتے ہیں، جس کے معنی یہ ہیں کہ آپ کو طرز عمل کے ان بنیادی اصولوں کی پیروی کرنی ہوگی: برآمد پر کنٹرول، پابندیوں اور انسانی ٹریفکنگ کے قوانین سمیت قابل اطلاق قوانین کی تعمیل کریں رازداری اور حقوق املاک دانش سمیت دوسروں کے حقوق کا احترام کریں دوسروں کے یا اپنے ساتھ زیادتی نہ کریں یا نقصان نہ پہنچائیں (یا ایسی زیادتی یا نقصان کی دھمکی یا ترغیب نہ دیں) — مثال کے طور پر، دوسروں کو گمراہ کر کے، دھوکہ دے کر، غیر قانونی شخصیت گیری کر کے، بدنام کر کے، دھمکا کر، ہراساں یا خوفزدہ کر کے ہماری سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط اور پالیسیاں ، جیسے کہ ہمارے تخلیق کر سکنے والے AI کی ممنوعہ استعمال کی پالیسی ، مناسب رویے کی اضافی تفصیلات فراہم کرتی ہیں جن پر عمل کرنا ان سروسز کو استعمال کرنے والے ہر شخص پر لازمی ہے۔ اگر آپ کو معلوم ہوتا ہے کہ دوسرے ان اصولوں کی پیروی نہیں کر رہے ہیں تو ہماری بہت سی سروسز میں بیجا استعمال کی اطلاع دینے کی سہولت موجود ہے۔ اگر ہم بیجا استعمال کی اطلاع دینے پر کارروائی کرتے ہیں تو ہم مسائل کی صورت میں کارروائی کرنا سیکشن میں بیان کردہ پراسیس بھی فراہم کرتے ہیں۔ ہماری سروسز کا بیجا استعمال نہ کریں ہماری سروسز تک رسائی کرنے یا ان کا استعمال کرنے والے بیشتر لوگ انٹرنیٹ کو محفوظ اور کھلا رکھنے والے عام اصولوں کو سمجھتے ہیں۔ بدقسمتی سے، چند لوگ ان اصولوں کا احترام نہیں کرتے ہیں، اسلئے بیجا استعمال سے ہماری سروسز اور صارفین کو تحفظ فراہم کرنے کیلئے، ہم یہاں ان کی وضاحت کر رہے ہیں۔ اس کے مطابق: آپ کو مندرجہ ذیل کاموں کے ذریعے ہماری سروسز یا سسٹمز کا بیجا استعمال نہیں کرنا چاہیے، انہیں نقصان نہیں پہنچانا چاہیے، ان کے ساتھ مداخلت نہیں کرنی چاہیے یا ان میں خلل پیدا نہیں کرنا چاہیے، مثال کے طور پر: میلوئیر متعارف کرانا سپامنگ کرنا، ہیک کرنا یا ہمارے سسٹمز یا حفاظتی اقدامات کو بائی پاس کرنا جیل بریکنگ، معاندانہ پرامپٹنگ یا پرامپٹ انجیکشن، ماسوا ہمارے تحفظ اور بَگ ٹیسٹنگ پروگرامز کے حصے کے طور پر دھوکہ دہی یا پُرفریب طریقوں سے ہماری سروسز یا مواد تک رسائی کرنا یا ان کا استعمال کرنا، جیسے: فریب دہی جعلی تجزیوں سمیت جعلی اکاؤنٹس یا مواد تخلیق کرنا دوسروں کو گمراہ کر کے انہیں یہ باور کرانا کہ تخلیق کر سکنے والا AI مواد انسان کے ذریعے تخلیق کیا گیا ہے ایسی سروسز فراہم کرنا جو بظاہر ایسی لگتی ہوں جیسے آپ کی (یا کسی اور شخص کی) جانب سے آئی ہوں، جبکہ حقیقتاً وہ ہماری جانب سے ہوں ایسی سروسز فراہم کرنا جو بظاہر ایسی لگتی ہوں جیسے ہماری جانب سے آئی ہوں، جبکہ ایسا نہ ہو کسی کے قانونی حقوق، جیسے املاک دانش یا رازداری کے حقوق کی خلاف ورزی کرنے کیلئے ہماری سروسز کا استعمال کرنا (اس مواد سمیت جو وہ فراہم کرتے ہیں) تجارتی راز یا حق ملکیت سے متعلق دیگر معلومات حاصل کرنے کیلئے، ماسوا ایسی معلومات کے جس کی قابل اطلاق قانون کے ذریعے اجازت حاصل ہے، ہماری سروسز یا اصل ٹیکنالوجی کی معکوس انجینیئرنگ کرنا، جیسے ہمارے مشین لرننگ کے ماڈلز ہمارے ویب صفحات پر مشین کے ذریعے پڑھی جا سکنے والی ہدایات کی خلاف ورزی کرتے ہوئے، ہماری کسی سروس کے مواد تک رسائی حاصل کرنے کیلئے خودکار وسائل کا استعمال کرنا (مثال کے طور پر، robots.txt فائلز جو کرالنگ کی اجازت نہیں دیتی ہیں، ٹریننگ اور دیگر سرگرمیاں) مشین لرننگ ماڈلز یا متعلقہ AI ٹیکنالوجی تیار کرنے کے لیے ہماری سروسز سے AI کے ذریعے تخلیق کردہ مواد کا استعمال کرنا ان شرائط کی خلاف ورزی کرنے کیلئے اس بات کو چھپانا یا غلط نمائندگی کرنا کہ آپ کون ہیں دوسروں کو ان شرائط کی خلاف ورزی کرنے کی ترغیب دینے والی سروسز فراہم کرنا آپ کے مواد کو استعمال کرنے کی اجازت ہماری کچھ سروسز آپ کو اپنا مواد اپ لوڈ کرنے، جمع کرانے، اسٹور کرنے، بھیجنے، وصول یا اشتراک کرنے کی سہولت دینے کیلئے تیار کی گئی ہیں۔ آپ پر ہماری سروسز کو کوئی بھی مواد فراہم کرنے کی ذمہ داری نہیں ہے اور فراہمی کیلئے آپ اپنی پسند کا مواد منتخب کرنے کیلئے آزاد ہیں۔ اگر آپ مواد اپ لوڈ کرنے یا اشتراک کرنے کا انتخاب کرتے ہیں تو براہ کرم یہ یقینی بنائیں کہ آپ کے پاس ایسا کرنے کے لازمی حقوق ہوں اور مواد قانون کے مطابق ہو۔ لائسنس آپ کا مواد آپ کا رہتا ہے، لہذا آپ اپنے مواد کے لیے اپنے حقوق املاک دانش کو برقرار رکھتے ہیں۔ مثال کے طور پر، آپ کے تخلیقی مواد جیسے کہ آپ کے لکھے ہوئے جائزوں میں آپ کو حقوق املاک دانش حاصل ہوتے ہیں۔ یا آپ کو کسی کے تخلیقی مواد کو اشتراک کرنے کا حق ہو سکتا ہے اگر انہوں نے آپ کو اجازت دی ہے۔ اگر آپ کے حقوق املاک دانش ہماری جانب سے آپ کے مواد کے استعمال کو محدود کرتے ہیں تو ہمیں آپ کی اجازت درکار ہوتی ہے۔ آپ اس لائسنس کے ذریعے Google کو وہ اجازت فراہم کرتے ہیں۔ اس میں کیا شامل ہے یہ لائسنس آپ کے مواد کا احاطہ کرتا ہے اگر وہ مواد حقوق املاک دانش سے محفوظ ہے۔ کس چیز کا احاطہ نہیں کرتا یہ لائسنس آپ کے رازداری کے حقوق کو متاثر نہیں کرتا — اس کا تعلق صرف آپ کی حقوق املاک دانش سے ہے یہ لائسنس مواد کی ان اقسام کا احاطہ نہیں کرتا: عوامی طور پر دستیاب حقائق پر مبنی معلومات جو آپ فراہم کرتے ہیں، جیسے مقامی کاروباری پتے کی درستگیاں۔ اس معلومات کو لائسنس کی ضرورت نہیں ہے کیونکہ یہ عام علم ہے اسے ہر شخص استعمال کر سکتا ہے۔ آپ جو تاثرات فراہم کرتے ہیں، جیسے ہماری سروسز کو بہتر بنانے کے لیے تجاویز۔ تاثرات کا احاطہ نیچے دئے گئے سروس سے متعلقہ مواصلات سیکشن میں کیا گیا ہے۔ دائرۂ کار یہ لائسنس: عالمگیر ہے، جس کا مطلب ہے کہ یہ دنیا میں کہیں بھی کارگر ہے غیر اختصاصی ہے، جس کا مطلب ہے کہ آپ اپنے مواد کو استعمال کرنے کی اجازت دوسروں کو دے سکتے ہیں رائلٹی فری ہے، جس کا مطلب ہے کہ اس لائسنس کے لیے کوئی مالی فیس نہیں ہے حقوق یہ لائسنس Google کو: مثال کے طور پر، اپنے سسٹمز پر آپ کا مواد محفوظ کرنے اور کہیں بھی جانے پر اسے قابل رسائی بنانے کیلئے آپ کے مواد کی میزبانی، دوبارہ پیش، تقسیم، ترسیل اور استعمال کرنے کی اجازت دیتا ہے اگر آپ نے اپنا مواد دوسروں کے لیے مرئی بنایا ہے تو اسے شائع کرنے، عوامی طور پر پرفارم کرنے یا عوامی طور پر دکھانے کی اجازت دیتا ہے آپ کے مواد میں ترمیم کرنے اور اس پر مبنی ماخوذ کام تخلیق کرنے کی اجازت دیتا ہے، جیسے اس کو دوبارہ فارمیٹ کرنا یا ترجمہ کرنا ذیل کو ان حقوق کا ضمنی لائسنس دینے کی اجازت دیتا ہے: دیگر صارفین کو تاکہ سروسز ویسے ہی کام کر پائیں جیسا ان کو بنایا گیا ہے، جیسے آپ کے منتخب کردہ لوگوں کے ساتھ آپ کو تصاویر کا اشتراک کرنے دینا ان شرائط کے ساتھ ہم آہنگ، ہمارے ساتھ اقرار ناموں پر دستخط کرنے والے ٹھیکیدار، صرف نیچے دئے گئے مقصد سیکشن میں بیان کردہ محدود مقاصد کیلئے مقصد یہ لائسنس ایک محدود مقصد کے لیے ہے جس میں شامل ہیں: سروسز کو چلانا اور بہتر بنانا ، جس کا مطلب ہے سروسز کو ڈیزائن کے مطابق کام کرنے کی اجازت دینا اور نئی خصوصیات اور فعالیتوں کو تخلیق کرنا۔ اس میں آپ کے مواد کا جائزہ لینے کے لیے خودکار سسٹمز اور الگورتھم استعمال کرنا شامل ہے: اسپام، میلوئیر اور غیر قانونی مواد ڈیٹا میں پیٹرنز کی شناخت کرنا، جیسے یہ تعین کرنا کہ متعلقہ تصاویر کو ساتھ رکھنے کیلئے Google تصاویر میں کب ایک نیا البم تجویز کیا جائے تجاویز اور تلاش کے ذاتی نوعیت کے نتائج، مواد اور اشتہارات فراہم کرنے جیسی ہماری سروسز کو آپ کی خاطر حسب ضرورت بنانے کیلئے (جسے آپ اشتہار کی ترتیبات میں تبدیل یا آف کر سکتے ہیں) یہ تجزیہ مواد بھیجنے، موصول کرنے اور اسٹور کرنے کے وقت ظاہر ہوتا ہے۔ اس مواد کا استعمال کرنا جس کا آپ نے سروسز کو فروغ دینے کے لیے عوامی طور پر اشتراک کیا ہے ۔ مثال کے طور پر، Google ایپ کو فروغ دینے کے لیے، ہم آپ کے لکھے ہوئے جائزے کا حوالہ دے سکتے ہیں۔ یا Google Play کو فروغ دینے کے لیے، ہم آپ کی Play اسٹور میں پیش کردہ ایپ کا اسکرین شاٹ دکھا سکتے ہیں۔ ان شرائط کے ساتھ ہم آہنگ Google کیلئے نئی ٹیکنالوجیز اور سروسز ڈیولپ کرنا دورانیہ یہ لائسنس اس وقت تک رہتا ہے جب تک آپ کے مواد کو حقوق املاک دانش کا تحفظ حاصل ہے۔ اگر آپ ہماری سروسز سے اس لائسنس کا احاطہ کردہ کوئی بھی مواد ہٹاتے ہیں تو ہمارے سسٹمز اس مواد کو معقول مدت کے اندر عوامی طور پر دستیاب کرانا بند کر دیں گے۔ دو مستثنیات ہیں: اگر آپ نے پہلے ہی اپنے مواد کو ہٹانے سے پہلے دوسروں کے ساتھ اس کا اشتراک کر لیا ہے۔ مثال کے طور پر، اگر آپ کسی ایسے دوست کے ساتھ ایک تصویر کا اشتراک کرتے ہیں جو بعد میں اس کی ایک کاپی بنا کر اس کا دوبارہ اشتراک کرتا ہے، تو آپ کی جانب سے اسے اپنے Google اکاؤنٹ سے ہٹانے کے بعد بھی وہ تصویر آپ کے دوست کے Google اکاؤنٹ میں مسلسل دکھائی دے سکتی ہے۔ اگر آپ اپنا مواد دوسری کمپنیوں کی سروسز کے ذریعے دستیاب کرتے ہیں تو سرچ انجنز، بشمول Google تلاش، آپ کے مواد کو ڈھونڈ سکتے ہیں اور اپنے تلاش کے نتائج میں ظاہر کر سکتے ہیں۔ Google کی سروسز کا استعمال آپ کا Google اکاؤنٹ اگر آپ ان عمر کے تقاضوں کو پورا کرتے ہیں تو اپنی سہولت کے لیے آپ Google اکاؤنٹ بنا سکتے ہیں۔ کچھ سروسز کو کام کرنے کے لیے Google اکاؤنٹ کی ضرورت ہوتی ہے - مثال کے طور پر Gmail کو استعمال کرنے کے لیے، آپ کو ایک Google اکاؤنٹ کی ضرورت ہے تاکہ آپ کو اپنا ای میل بھیجنے اور وصول کرنے کے لئے جگہ مل سکے۔ آپ اپنے Google اکاؤنٹ کے ساتھ جو کچھ کرتے ہیں اس کے ذمہ دار ہیں، بشمول اپنے Google اکاؤنٹ کو محفوظ رکھنے کے لئے معقول اقدامات کرنا، اور ہم آپ کو باقاعدگی سے سیکیورٹی چیک اپ کو استعمال کرنے کی ترغیب دیتے ہیں۔ کسی تنظیم یا کاروبار کی جانب سے Google سروسز کا استعمال کاروباروں، غیر منفعتی تنظیموں اور اسکولوں جیسی کئی تنظیمیں ہماری سروسز کا فائدہ اٹھاتی ہیں۔ کسی تنظیم کی طرف سے ہماری سروسز استعمال کرنے کیلئے: اس تنظیم کے مجاز نمائندے کو ان شرائط سے اتفاق کرنا ہوگا آپ کی تنظیم کا منتظم آپ کو ایک Google اکاؤنٹ تفویض کر سکتا ہے۔ ہو سکتا ہے کہ وہ منتظم آپ سے اضافی اصولوں کی پیروی کرنے کو کہے اور ممکن ہے کہ وہ آپ کے Google اکاؤنٹ تک رسائی حاصل کرنے یا اسے غیر فعال کرنے کا اہل ہو۔ سروس سے متعلقہ مواصلات آپ کو اپنی سروسز فراہم کرنے کیلئے، ہم آپ کو کبھی کبھار سروس کے اعلانات اور دیگر معلومات بھیجتے ہیں۔ ہم آپ کے ساتھ کیسے مواصلت کرتے ہیں، اس کے بارے میں مزید جاننے کیلئے Google کی رازداری کی پالیسی دیکھیں۔ اگر آپ ہمیں ہماری سروسز کو بہتر بنانے کیلئے تجاویز جیسے تاثرات دینے کا انتخاب کرتے ہیں تو ہم آپ کے تئیں کسی پابندی کے بغیر آپ کے تاثرات پر کارروائی کر سکتے ہیں۔ Google سروسز میں موجود مواد آپ کا مواد ہماری کچھ سروسز آپ کو اصل مواد تیار کرنے کی سہولت دیتی ہیں۔ Google اُس مواد پر ملکیت کا دعوی نہیں کرے گا۔ ہماری کچھ سروسز آپ کو اپنے مواد کو عوامی طور پر دستیاب کرنے کا موقع فراہم کرتی ہیں — مثال کے طور پر، آپ اپنی مصنوعات یا ریسٹورنٹ کا جائزہ پوسٹ کر سکتے ہیں جو آپ نے لکھا ہے، یا آپ اپنی تخلیق کردہ بلاگ پوسٹ اپ لوڈ کر سکتے ہیں۔ آپ کا مواد میں اپنے حقوق اور ہماری سروسز میں آپ کے مواد کے استعمال کے طریقے کے بارے میں مزید جاننے کیلئے، آپ کے مواد کا استعمال کرنے کی اجازت سیکشن دیکھیں صارف کے ذریعے تیار کردہ مواد کو ہم اپنی سروسز سے کیوں اور کیسے ہٹا سکتے ہیں یہ جاننے کے لیے آپ کے مواد کو ہٹانا سیکشن دیکھیں اگر آپ سمجھتے ہیں کہ کوئی شخص آپ کے حقوق املاک دانش سے انحراف کر رہا ہے تو آپ ہمیں انحراف کا نوٹس بھیج سکتے ہیں اور ہم مناسب کارروائی کریں گے۔ مثال کے طور پر، جیسا کہ ہمارے کاپی رائٹ کے مرکز امداد میں بیان کیا گیا ہے، ہم کاپی رائٹ کا مکرر انحراف کرنے والے Google اکاؤنٹس کو معطل یا بند کر دیتے ہیں۔ Google مواد ہماری کچھ سروسز میں ایسا مواد ہے جس کا تعلق Google سے ہے — مثال کے طور پر، بہت سے ویژوئل خاکے جو آپ Google Maps میں دیکھتے ہیں۔ آپ Google کے مواد کو ان شرائط اور کسی بھی سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط کی اجازت کے مطابق استعمال کرسکتے ہیں، لیکن ہم اپنے مواد میں موجود کسی بھی حقوق املاک دانش کو برقرار رکھتے ہیں۔ قانونی اطلاعات، برانڈ سازی یا لوگوز نہ ہٹائیں، انہیں ناقابل فہم نہ بنائیں، یا ان میں چھیڑ چھاڑ نہ کریں۔ اگر آپ ہماری برانڈ سازی یا لوگوز کو استعمال کرنا چاہتے ہیں تو براہ کرم Google برانڈ کی اجازتیں والا صفحہ دیکھیں۔ دوسرا مواد بالآخر، ہماری کچھ سروسز آپ کو دوسرے لوگوں یا تنظیموں کے مواد تک رسائی دیتی ہیں — مثال کے طور پر، ایک اسٹور کے مالک کے اپنے کاروبار کی تفصیل یا Google News میں ڈسپلے کردہ کسی اخباری مضمون تک۔ آپ اس شخص یا تنظیم کی اجازت یا بصورت دیگر قانون کی اجازت کے بغیر اس مواد کا استعمال نہیں کر سکتے۔ دیگر لوگوں یا تنظیموں کے مواد پر بیان کردہ نظریات ان کے اپنے ہیں اور ضروری نہیں کہ وہ Google کے نظریات کی عکاسی کرتے ہوں۔ Google سروسز میں سافٹ ویئر ہماری کچھ سروسز میں ڈاؤن لوڈ کرنے لائق یا پیشگی لوڈ کردہ سافٹ ویئر شامل ہے۔ ہم آپ کو سروسز کے حصے کے طور پر اس سافٹ ویئر کا استعمال کرنے کی اجازت دیتے ہیں۔ ہم جو لائسنس آپ کو دیتے ہيں وہ: عالمگیر ہے، جس کا یہ مطلب ہے کہ یہ دنیا بھر میں کہیں بھی کارگر ہے غیر اختصاصی ہے، جس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ ہم سافٹ ویئر کا لائسنس دوسروں کو دے سکتے ہیں رائلٹی فری ہے، جس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ اس لائسنس کی کوئی مالی فیس نہيں ہے ذاتی ہے، جس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ اس کی وسعت کسی اور تک نہیں ہو سکتی ہے ناقابل تفویض ہے، جس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ آپ کو کسی اور کو لائسنس تفویض کرنے کی اجازت نہيں ہے ہماری کچھ سروسز میں اوپن سورس لائسنس کی شرائط کے تحت فراہم کردہ سافٹ ویئر شامل ہے جو ہم آپ کو فراہم کرتے ہیں۔ اوپن سورس لائسنس میں بعض اوقات ایسی شرائط ہوتی ہیں جو واضح طور پر ان شرائط کے کچھ حصوں کو اوور رائیڈ کردیتی ہیں، لہذا ان لائسنسز کو ضرور پڑھیں۔ آپ ہماری سروسز یا سافٹ ویئر کے کسی بھی حصے کو کاپی، تبدیل، تقسیم، فروخت نہیں کر سکتے یا کرایے پر نہیں دے سکتے۔ مسائل یا اختلاف رائے کی صورت میں قانون اور یہ شرائط آپ کو (1) سروس کے مخصوص معیار، اور (2) کچھ غلط ہو جانے کی صورت میں مسائل حل کرنے کے طریقے فراہم کرتی ہیں۔ وارنٹی ہم معقول مہارت اور دیکھ بھال کا استعمال کرتے ہوئے اپنی سروسز فراہم کرتے ہیں۔ اگر ہم اس وارنٹی میں بیان کردہ کوالٹی لیول کو برقرار نہیں رکھتے ہیں تو آپ ہمیں بتانے سے اتفاق کرتے ہیں اور ہم آپ کے ساتھ اس مسئلے کو حل کرنے کی کوشش کریں گے۔ اعلاناتِ دستبرداری رف ہماری سروسز (بشمول سروسز میں موجود مواد، ہماری سروسز کے مخصوص فنکشنز، یا ان کے اعتماد، دستیابی، یا آپ کی ضروریات کو پورا کرنے کی اہلیت) کے بارے میں ہم جو یقین دہانیاں کرتے ہیں وہ (1) وارنٹی سیکشن؛ (2) سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط اور (3) قوانین کے تحت فراہم کی گئی ہیں جو ان شرائط سے محدود نہیں ہو سکتے۔ طبی، قانونی، مالیاتی یا دیگر پیشہ ورانہ مشورے کے لیے سروسز پر انحصار نہ کریں۔ ان موضوعات سے متعلق کسی بھی مواد کو صرف معلوماتی مقاصد کے لیے فراہم کیا جاتا ہے اور وہ کسی اہل پیشہ ور کے مشورے کا متبادل نہیں ہے۔ ذمہ داریاں تمام صارفین کیلئے قانون اور یہ شرائط اس حوالے سے توازن پیدا کرنے کی کوشش کرتی ہیں کہ مسائل کی صورت میں آپ یا Google ایک دوسرے پر کیا دعوی کر سکتے ہیں۔ یہی وجہ ہے کہ قانون ہر کسی سے ان شرائط کے تحت بعض ذمہ داریوں کے تئیں ذمہ دار ہونے کا تقاضہ کرتا ہے، مگر دیگر کیلئے نہیں۔ یہ شرائط ہماری ذمہ داریوں کو صرف قابل اطلاق قانون کی اجازت کی حد تک محدود کرتی ہیں۔ یہ شرائط مندرجہ ذیل ذمہ داری کو محدود نہیں کرتی ہیں: دھوکہ دہی یا پر فریب غلط ترجمانی بے توجہی یا دانستہ غلط طرز عمل کے نتیجے میں موت یا ذاتی چوٹ مجموعی بے توجہی دانستہ غلط طرز عمل اوپر بیان کردہ ذمہ داریوں کے علاوہ، Google صرف ان شرائط یا قابل اطلاق سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط کی اپنی خلاف ورزیوں کیلئے ذمہ دار ہے، یہ قابل اطلاق قانون کے ساتھ مشروط ہے۔ صرف کاروباری صارفین اور تنظیموں کیلئے اگر آپ ایک کاروباری صارف یا تنظیم ہیں: قابل اطلاق قانون کے ذریعے دی گئی اجازت کی حد تک آپ Google اور اس کے ڈائریکٹرز، افسران، ملازمین، اور ٹھیکیداروں کو سروسز کے آپ کے غیر قانونی استعمال سے متعلق یا ان شرائط یا سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط کی خلاف ورزی سے متعلق یا پیش آنے والی کسی بھی تیسری پارٹی کی قانونی کارروائی (بشمول سرکاری حکام کی کارروائیوں) کے لیے حرجانہ ادا کریں گے ۔ یہ ہرجانہ دعوؤں، خساروں، نقصانات، فیصلوں، جرمانوں، قانونی چارہ جوئی کے اخراجات، اور قانونی فیس سے پیدا ہونے والی کسی بھی جوابدہی یا اخراجات کا احاطہ کرتا ہے، سوائے اس حد کے کہ کوئی ذمہ داری یا خرچ Google کی خلاف ورزی، بے توجہی یا جان بوجھ کر غلط طرز عمل کی وجہ سے ہو۔ اگر آپ ہرجانہ سمیت کچھ ذمہ داریوں سے قانونی طور پر مبرّا ہیں تو ان شرائط کے تحت اُن ذمہ داریوں کا اطلاق آپ پر نہیں ہوتا ہے۔ مثال کے طور پر، اقوام متحدہ کو استثنیٰ حاصل ہے جو اسے کچھ قانونی ذمہ داریوں سے مستثنیٰ قرار دیتا ہے، اور یہ شرائط اُن استثنیٰ کو اوور رائیڈ نہیں کرتی ہیں۔ درج ذیل ذمہ داریوں کے لیے Google جوابدہ نہیں ہوگا: منافع، آمدنیاں، کاروبار کے مواقع، نیک نامی، یا متوقع بچت کا نقصان بالواسطہ یا نتائجی نقصان تادیبی نقصانات ماسوائے جیسا کہ اوپر بیان کردہ تمام صارفین کیلئے سیکشن میں بیان کیا گیا ہے، خلاف ورزی سے پہلے 12 ماہ میں متعلقہ سروسز استعمال کرنے کے لیے، ان شرائط سے پیدا ہونے والی یا ان سے متعلق Google کی کل ذمہ داری (1) 500$ امریکی ڈالر یا (2) فیس کے %125 میں سے جو بھی زیادہ ہو تک محدود ہے جو آپ نے ادا کی۔ خرابیوں کی صورت میں کاروائی کرنا ذیل میں بیان کردہ کے مطابق کارروائی کرنے سے پہلے، جب معقول طور پر ممکن ہو گا ہم آپ کو پیشگی اطلاع دیں گے، اپنی کاروائی کی وجہ بیان کریں گے، اور آپ کو مسئلے کی وضاحت کرنے اور اسے حل کرنے کا موقع دیں گے، الا یہ کہ ہمیں معقول طور پر یقین ہو کہ ایسا کرنے سے: کسی صارف، فریق ثالث یا Google کو نقصان پہنچے گا یا ان کیلئے ذمہ داری کا باعث بنے گا قانون یا قانون نافذ کرنے والی اتھارٹی کے آرڈر کی خلاف ورزی ہو گی کسی تفتیش کی خلاف ورزی ہو گی ہماری سروسز کے آپریشن، سالمیت، یا سیکیورٹی سے سمجھوتہ ہو گا اپنا مواد ہٹانا اگر ہمیں معقول طور پر ایسا لگتا ہے کہ آپ کا کوئی مواد (1) ان شرائط، سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط یا پالیسیوں کی خلاف ورزی کرتا ہے، (2) قابل اطلاق قانون کی خلاف ورزی کرتا ہے یا (3) ہمارے صارفین، فریقین ثالث یا Google کو نقصان پہنچا سکتا ہے تو ہمارے پاس قابل اطلاق قانون کے مطابق کچھ یا پورے مواد کو خارج کرنے کا حق محفوظ ہے۔ مثالوں میں بچوں پر مشتمل پورنوگرافی، ایسا مواد جو انسانوں کی غیر قانونی خرید و فروخت یا ہراساں کرنے کی سہولت فراہم کرتا ہو، دہشت گردی سے متعلق مواد اور ایسا مواد جو کسی اور کے دانشورانہ املاک کے حقوق کی خلاف ورزی کرتا ہو شامل ہیں۔ Google کی سروسز تک آپ کی رسائی معطل یا بند کرنا ہمارے دیگر حقوق میں سے کسی کو محدود کئے بغیر، اگر مندرجہ ذیل چیزوں میں سے کچھ بھی ہوتا ہے تو Google سروسز تک آپ کی رسائی کو معطل یا ختم کر سکتا ہے یا آپ کے Google اکاؤنٹ کو حذف کر سکتا ہے: آپ مادی طور پر یا بار بار ان شرائط کی خلاف ورزی کرتے ہیں، سروس سے متعلق مخصوص اضافی شرائط یا پالیسیاں قانونی تقاضے یا کسی عدالتی حکم کی تعمیل کرنے کیلئے ہمیں ایسا کرنا ضروری ہے ہم معقول طور پر یہ مانتے ہیں کہ آپ کا طرز عمل کسی صارف، فریق ثالث یا Google کیلئے نقصان یا جوابدہی کی وجہ بنتا ہے — مثال کے طور پر ہیکنگ، فریب دہی، ہراساں، اسپامنگ، دوسروں کو گمراہ کرنا یا ایسے مواد کو ہٹانا جو آپ کا نہ ہو س سے متعلق مزید معلومات کیلئے کہ ہم اکاؤنٹس کیوں غیر فعال کرتے ہیں اور ہمارے ایسا کرنے کا نتیجہ کیا نکلتا ہے، یہ امدادی مرکز کا صفحہ ملاحظہ کریں۔ اگر آپ کو لگتا ہے کہ آپ کا Google اکاؤنٹ غلطی سے معطل یا ختم کر دیا گیا ہے تو آپ اپیل کر سکتے ہیں ۔۔ یقیناً، آپ کسی بھی وقت ہماری سروسز کا استعمال بند کرنے کیلئے ہمیشہ آزاد ہیں۔ اگر آپ کسی سروس کا استعمال بند کرتے ہیں تو ہمیں اس کی وجہ جان کر خوشی ہوگی تاکہ ہم اپنی سروسز کو بہتر بنانا جاری رکھ سکیں۔ تنازعات کو طے کرنا، فیصلہ کن قانون اور عدالتیں Google سے رابطہ کرنے کے طریقے کی بابت معلومات کیلئے، براہ کرم ہمارا رابطہ کا صفحہ دیکھیں۔ ان شرائط، سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط یا کوئی بھی متعلقہ سروسز سے قوانین و قواعد کے تصادم کے قطع نظر پیدا ہونے والے تمام تنازعات پر کیلی فورنیا کے قانون کا اطلاق ہوگا۔ ان تنازعات کو کلی طور پر سانتا کلارا کاؤنٹی، کیلیفورنیا، USA کی وفاقی یا ریاستی عدالتوں میں حل کیا جائے گا، اور آپ اور Google ان عدالتوں میں ذاتی دائرہ اختیار کو منظور کرتے ہیں۔ اس حد تک کہ قابل اطلاق مقامی قانون کیلی فورنیا کی کسی عدالت میں بعض تنازعات کو حل کئے جانے سے روکتا ہے تو آپ اپنی مقامی عدالتوں میں یہ تنازعات دائر کر سکتے ہیں۔ اسی طرح، اگر قابل اطلاق مقامی قانون آپ کی مقامی عدالت کو ان تنازعات کے حل کیلئے کیلی فورنیا کے قانون کا اطلاق کرنے سے روکتا ہے تو یہ تنازعات آپ کے ملک، اسٹیٹ یا دیگر جگہ کے قوانین کے زیر انتظام ہوں گے جہاں آپ رہائش پذیر ہیں۔ ان شرائط کے بارے میں آپ کو قانون کے توسط سے چند ایسے مخصوص حقوق حاصل ہیں جنہیں سروس کی ان شرائط جیسے معاہدے سے محدود نہیں کیا جا سکتا۔ ان شرائط کا مقصد کسی بھی طرح ان حقوق کو محدود کرنا نہیں ہے۔ یہ شرائط آپ کے اور Google کے مابین رشتے کی وضاحت کرتی ہیں۔ یہ دوسرے لوگوں یا تنظیموں کیلئے کوئی قانونی حق تخلیق نہیں کرتی ہیں، چاہے ان شرائط کے تحت دوسروں کو اس رشتے سے فائدہ ہی کیوں نہ پہنچ رہا ہو۔ ہم ان شرائط کو سمجھنے کے لیے آسان بنانا چاہتے ہیں، لہذا ہم نے اپنی سروسز سے مثالوں کو استعمال کیا ہے۔ لیکن ممکن ہے ذکر کردہ یہ سبھی سروسز آپ کے ملک میں دستیاب نہ ہوں۔ اگر ان شرائط اور سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط کے مابین تضاد ہے تو وہ سروس اضافی شرائط کے زیر انتظام ہوگی۔ اگر یہ پتہ چلتا ہے کہ ایک مخصوص شرط درست یا قابل نفاذ نہیں ہے تو، اس سے دیگر شرائط پر اثر نہیں پڑے گا۔ اگر آپ ان شرائط یا سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط کی پیروی نہیں کرتے ہیں اور ہم اسی وقت کارروائی نہیں کرتے ہیں تو اس کا مطلب یہ نہیں ہے کہ ہم مستقبل میں کارروائی کرنے جیسے کسی ایسے حقوق سے دست کش ہو رہے ہیں جو ہمارے پاس ہو سکتے ہیں۔ ہم ان شرائط اور سروس کے ساتھ مخصوص اضافی شرائط کو اپ ڈیٹ کر سکتے ہیں (1) ہماری سروسز میں کی جانے والی تبدیلیوں یا اپنے کاروبار کرنے کے طریقے کو ظاہر کرنے کیلئے — مثال کے طور پر، جب ہم نئی سروسز، خصوصیات، ٹیکنالوجیز، قیمت یا فوائد شامل کرتے ہیں (یا پرانی سروسز، خصوصیات، ٹیکنالوجیز، قیمت یا فوائد کو ہٹاتے ہیں)، (2) قانونی، ریگولیٹری یا سیکیورٹی کی وجوہات کیلئے یا (3) بیجا استعمال یا نقصان کی روک تھام کیلئے۔ اگر ہم مادی طور پر ان شرائط یا سروس سے متعلق مخصوص اضافی شرائط میں تبدیلی کریں گے تو ہم آپ کو مناسب پیشگی اطلاع دیں گے اور تبدیلیوں پر نظرثانی کرنے کا موقع فراہم کریں گے، سوائے اس کے کہ (1) جب ہم کسی نئی سروس یا خصوصیت کا آغاز کریں گے، یا (2) فوری صورتحال میں، جیسے جاری ناجائز استعمال کو روکنا یا قانونی تقاضوں کا جواب دینا۔ اگر آپ نئی شرائط سے اتفاق نہيں کرتے ہیں تو آپ کو اپنا مواد ہٹا دینا چاہئے اور سروسز کا استعمال بند کر دینا چاہئے۔ آپ اپنے Google اکاؤنٹ کو بند کر کے کسی بھی وقت ہم سے اپنے تعلقات کو ختم بھی کر سکتے ہيں۔ تعریفیں اعلان دستبرداری ایسا بیان جو کسی شخص کی قانونی ذمہ داریوں کو محدود کرتا ہے۔ آپ کا مواد جو چیزیں آپ

https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=ur,"Ten things we know to be true - Google Jump to content About Products Commitments Ten things we know to be true We first wrote these â10 thingsâ when Google was just a few years old. From time to
  time we revisit this list to see if it still holds true. We hope it doesâand you can
  hold us to that. 1. Focus on the user and all else will follow. Since the beginning, weâve focused on providing the best user experience possible.
  Whether weâre designing a new internet browser or a new tweak to the look of the
  homepage, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately serve you, rather
  than our own internal goal or bottom line. Our homepage interface is clear and
  simple, and pages load instantly. Placement in search results is never sold to
  anyone, and advertising is not only clearly marked as such, it offers relevant
  content and is not distracting. And when we build new tools and applications, we
  believe they should work so well you donât have to consider how they might have been
  designed differently. 2. Itâs best to do one thing really, really well. We do search. With one of the worldâs largest research groups focused exclusively on
  solving search problems, we know what we do well, and how we could do it better.
  Through continued iteration on difficult problems, weâve been able to solve complex
  issues and provide continuous improvements to a service that already makes finding
  information a fast and seamless experience for millions of people. Our dedication to
  improving search helps us apply what weâve learned to new products, like Gmail and
  Google Maps. Our hope is to bring the power of search to previously unexplored areas,
  and to help people access and use even more of the ever-expanding information in
  their lives. 3. Fast is better than slow. We know your time is valuable, so when youâre seeking an answer on the web you want
  it right awayâand we aim to please. We may be the only people in the world who can
  say our goal is to have people leave our website as quickly as possible. By shaving
  excess bits and bytes from our pages and increasing the efficiency of our serving
  environment, weâve broken our own speed records many times over, so that the average
  response time on a search result is a fraction of a second. We keep speed in mind
  with each new product we release, whether itâs a mobile application or Google Chrome,
  a browser designed to be fast enough for the modern web. And we continue to work on
  making it all go even faster. 4. Democracy on the web works. Google search works because it relies on the millions of individuals posting links on
  websites to help determine which other sites offer content of value. We assess the
  importance of every web page using more than 200 signals and a variety of techniques,
  including our patented PageRankâ¢ algorithm, which analyzes which sites have been
  âvotedâ to be the best sources of information by other pages across the web. As the
  web gets bigger, this approach actually improves, as each new site is another point
  of information and another vote to be counted. In the same vein, we are active in
  open source software development, where innovation takes place through the collective
  effort of many programmers. 5. You donât need to be at your desk to need an answer. The world is increasingly mobile: people want access to information wherever they
  are, whenever they need it. Weâre pioneering new technologies and offering new
  solutions for mobile services that help people all over the globe to do any number of
  tasks on their phone, from checking email and calendar events to watching videos, not
  to mention the several different ways to access Google search on a phone. In
  addition, weâre hoping to fuel greater innovation for mobile users everywhere with Android, 
  an open source mobile platform free of charge. Android brings the openness that shaped
  the internet to the mobile world. Not only does Android benefit consumers, who have
  more choice and innovative new mobile experiences, but it opens up revenue
  opportunities for carriers, manufacturers and developers. 6. You can make money without doing evil. Google is a business. The revenue we generate is derived from offering search
  technology to companies and from the sale of advertising displayed on our site and on
  other sites across the web. Hundreds of thousands of advertisers worldwide use
  Google Ads to promote their products; hundreds of thousands of publishers take advantage
  of our AdSense program to deliver ads relevant to their site content. To ensure that
  weâre ultimately serving all our users (whether they are advertisers or not), we have
  a set of guiding principles for our advertising programs and practices: We donât allow ads to be displayed on our results pages unless they are relevant
      where they are shown. And we firmly believe that ads can provide useful
      information if, and only if, they are relevant to what you wish to findâso itâs
      possible that certain searches wonât lead to any ads at all. We believe that advertising can be effective without being flashy. We donât
      accept popâup advertising, which interferes with your ability to see the content
      youâve requested. Weâve found that text ads that are relevant to the person
      reading them draw much higher clickthrough rates than ads appearing randomly. Any
      advertiser, whether small or large, can take advantage of this highly targeted
      medium. Advertising on Google is always clearly identified as a âSponsored Link,â so it
      does not compromise the integrity of our search results. We never manipulate
      rankings to put our partners higher in our search results and no one can buy
      better PageRank. Our users trust our objectivity and no short-term gain could
      ever justify breaching that trust. 7. Thereâs always more information out there. Once weâd indexed more of the HTML pages on the internet than any other search
  service, our engineers turned their attention to information that was not as readily
  accessible. Sometimes it was just a matter of integrating new databases into search,
  such as adding a phone number and address lookup and a business directory. Other
  efforts required a bit more creativity, like adding the ability to search news
  archives, patents, academic journals, billions of images and millions of books. And
  our researchers continue looking into ways to bring all the worldâs information to
  people seeking answers. 8. The need for information crosses all borders. Our company was founded in California, but our mission is to facilitate access to
  information for the entire world, and in every language. To that end, we have offices
  in more than 60 countries, maintain more than 180 internet domains, and serve more
  than half of our results to people living outside the United States. We offer
  Googleâs search interface in more than 130 languages, offer people the ability to
  restrict results to content written in their own language, and aim to provide the
  rest of our applications and products in as many languages and accessible formats as
  possible. Using our translation tools, people can discover content written on the
  other side of the world in languages they donât speak. With these tools and the help
  of volunteer translators, we have been able to greatly improve both the variety and
  quality of services we can offer in even the most farâflung corners of the globe. 9. You can be serious without a suit. Our founders built Google around the idea that work should be challenging, and the
  challenge should be fun. We believe that great, creative things are more likely to
  happen with the right company cultureâand that doesnât just mean lava lamps and
  rubber balls. There is an emphasis on team achievements and pride in individual
  accomplishments that contribute to our overall success. We put great stock in our
  employeesâenergetic, passionate people from diverse backgrounds with creative
  approaches to work, play and life. Our atmosphere may be casual, but as new ideas
  emerge in a cafÃ© line, at a team meeting or at the gym, they are traded, tested and
  put into practice with dizzying speedâand they may be the launch pad for a new
  project destined for worldwide use. 10. Great just isnât good enough. We see being great at something as a starting point, not an endpoint. We set
  ourselves goals we know we canât reach yet, because we know that by stretching to
  meet them we can get further than we expected. Through innovation and iteration, we
  aim to take things that work well and improve upon them in unexpected ways. For
  example, when one of our engineers saw that search worked well for properly spelled
  words, he wondered about how it handled typos. That led him to create an intuitive
  and more helpful spell checker. Even if you donât know exactly what youâre looking for, finding an answer on the web
  is our problem, not yours. We try to anticipate needs not yet articulated by our
  global audience, and meet them with products and services that set new standards.
  When we launched Gmail, it had more storage space than any email service available.
  In retrospect offering that seems obviousâbut thatâs because now we have new
  standards for email storage. Those are the kinds of changes we seek to make, and
  weâre always looking for new places where we can make a difference. Ultimately, our
  constant dissatisfaction with the way things are becomes the driving force behind
  everything we do.

https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=ur#page-content,"Ten things we know to be true - Google Jump to content About Products Commitments Ten things we know to be true We first wrote these â10 thingsâ when Google was just a few years old. From time to
  time we revisit this list to see if it still holds true. We hope it doesâand you can
  hold us to that. 1. Focus on the user and all else will follow. Since the beginning, weâve focused on providing the best user experience possible.
  Whether weâre designing a new internet browser or a new tweak to the look of the
  homepage, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately serve you, rather
  than our own internal goal or bottom line. Our homepage interface is clear and
  simple, and pages load instantly. Placement in search results is never sold to
  anyone, and advertising is not only clearly marked as such, it offers relevant
  content and is not distracting. And when we build new tools and applications, we
  believe they should work so well you donât have to consider how they might have been
  designed differently. 2. Itâs best to do one thing really, really well. We do search. With one of the worldâs largest research groups focused exclusively on
  solving search problems, we know what we do well, and how we could do it better.
  Through continued iteration on difficult problems, weâve been able to solve complex
  issues and provide continuous improvements to a service that already makes finding
  information a fast and seamless experience for millions of people. Our dedication to
  improving search helps us apply what weâve learned to new products, like Gmail and
  Google Maps. Our hope is to bring the power of search to previously unexplored areas,
  and to help people access and use even more of the ever-expanding information in
  their lives. 3. Fast is better than slow. We know your time is valuable, so when youâre seeking an answer on the web you want
  it right awayâand we aim to please. We may be the only people in the world who can
  say our goal is to have people leave our website as quickly as possible. By shaving
  excess bits and bytes from our pages and increasing the efficiency of our serving
  environment, weâve broken our own speed records many times over, so that the average
  response time on a search result is a fraction of a second. We keep speed in mind
  with each new product we release, whether itâs a mobile application or Google Chrome,
  a browser designed to be fast enough for the modern web. And we continue to work on
  making it all go even faster. 4. Democracy on the web works. Google search works because it relies on the millions of individuals posting links on
  websites to help determine which other sites offer content of value. We assess the
  importance of every web page using more than 200 signals and a variety of techniques,
  including our patented PageRankâ¢ algorithm, which analyzes which sites have been
  âvotedâ to be the best sources of information by other pages across the web. As the
  web gets bigger, this approach actually improves, as each new site is another point
  of information and another vote to be counted. In the same vein, we are active in
  open source software development, where innovation takes place through the collective
  effort of many programmers. 5. You donât need to be at your desk to need an answer. The world is increasingly mobile: people want access to information wherever they
  are, whenever they need it. Weâre pioneering new technologies and offering new
  solutions for mobile services that help people all over the globe to do any number of
  tasks on their phone, from checking email and calendar events to watching videos, not
  to mention the several different ways to access Google search on a phone. In
  addition, weâre hoping to fuel greater innovation for mobile users everywhere with Android, 
  an open source mobile platform free of charge. Android brings the openness that shaped
  the internet to the mobile world. Not only does Android benefit consumers, who have
  more choice and innovative new mobile experiences, but it opens up revenue
  opportunities for carriers, manufacturers and developers. 6. You can make money without doing evil. Google is a business. The revenue we generate is derived from offering search
  technology to companies and from the sale of advertising displayed on our site and on
  other sites across the web. Hundreds of thousands of advertisers worldwide use
  Google Ads to promote their products; hundreds of thousands of publishers take advantage
  of our AdSense program to deliver ads relevant to their site content. To ensure that
  weâre ultimately serving all our users (whether they are advertisers or not), we have
  a set of guiding principles for our advertising programs and practices: We donât allow ads to be displayed on our results pages unless they are relevant
      where they are shown. And we firmly believe that ads can provide useful
      information if, and only if, they are relevant to what you wish to findâso itâs
      possible that certain searches wonât lead to any ads at all. We believe that advertising can be effective without being flashy. We donât
      accept popâup advertising, which interferes with your ability to see the content
      youâve requested. Weâve found that text ads that are relevant to the person
      reading them draw much higher clickthrough rates than ads appearing randomly. Any
      advertiser, whether small or large, can take advantage of this highly targeted
      medium. Advertising on Google is always clearly identified as a âSponsored Link,â so it
      does not compromise the integrity of our search results. We never manipulate
      rankings to put our partners higher in our search results and no one can buy
      better PageRank. Our users trust our objectivity and no short-term gain could
      ever justify breaching that trust. 7. Thereâs always more information out there. Once weâd indexed more of the HTML pages on the internet than any other search
  service, our engineers turned their attention to information that was not as readily
  accessible. Sometimes it was just a matter of integrating new databases into search,

  archives, patents, academic journals, billions of images and millions of books. And

https://www.google.com/about/human-rights/?utm_source=about&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=footer-link,"About Human Rights at Google - Google About Products Commitments Human Rights In their first letter to shareholders , our founders highlighted Googleâs goal to âdevelop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible.â This vision continues to guide all of us at Google. We believe in technologyâs power and potential to have a profoundly positive impact across the world. In everything we do, including launching new products and expanding our operations around the globe, we are guided by internationally recognized human rights standards. We are committed to respecting the rights enshrined  in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its implementing treaties, as well as upholding the standards established in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and in the Global Network Initiative Principles (GNI Principles). In addition to actively harnessing the power of technology to advance human rights and create new opportunities for people across the globe, we are committed to responsible decision-making around emerging technologies. EXECUTIVE OVERSIGHT AND BOARD GOVERNANCE Google's work on civil rights and human rights is conducted through our Human Rights Program, a central function responsible for ensuring -- across Google and all its products (such as hardware, Search, Cloud, and YouTube) -- that we are meeting our commitment to the UNGPs, GNI Principles, and other civil and human rights instruments. Senior management oversees the implementation of the civil rights and human rights work and provides regular updates to the Audit and Compliance Committee of Alphabetâs Board of Directors. In 2020, the Board amended the charter of the Audit and Compliance Committee to explicitly include oversight of civil and human rights issues. As we grow as a company, we continue to enhance and evolve our implementation of our human rights commitments. For example, our Human Rights Executive Council (HREC) provides oversight and guidance to our Human Rights Program on global human rights and domestic civil rights in the U.S. Council members represent key product areas and functions across Google and regularly hear from the leaders of the Human Rights Program. HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRAM The Human Rights Program advances company-wide strategy on civil and human rights, advises product teams on potential civil and human rights impacts, conducts human rights due diligence, and engages external experts and stakeholders. Our civil and human rights work is integrated into processes and procedures across the company. A network of employees covering product, regional, and functional areas is responsible for the day-to-day work of protecting our users. Employees can also raise concerns about human and civil rights, which are reviewed by the Human Rights Program and senior management, as relevant. Due Diligence and Risk Management We incorporate civil and human rights principles into Googleâs long-term strategies and day-to-day decision-making. Google has product-specific counsel advising product teams who are part of the development and deployment of new products and features. Product and regional counsel, in coordination with subject-matter and regional experts among Googleâs policy staff, assess legal and policy risks. For instance, we conducted and released a voluntary civil rights audit of our policies, practices, and products. This audit was conducted by the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, LLP, and it identifies significant strengths, as well as opportunities for Google and Alphabet to further advance civil rights, equity, and inclusion. The Human Rights Program also manages human rights due diligence, including human rights impact assessments, and works with internal stakeholders in areas such as data governance, content policies, and supply chain. Engagement Engaging with external experts and affected stakeholders is essential to our civil and human rights work. Regular engagement and formal consultation with civil society and other stakeholders informs the development of our products and policies. These engagements help us identify, prioritize, and address existing and potential civil and human rights impacts. They also present important opportunities for Google to get feedback on how and where we should consider improvements to our policies, practices, and services. TRANSPARENCY Transparency is core to our commitment to respect human rights. In 2010, we were the first internet company to launch a tool to inform the public about government requests for user data or content removal. Today the Google Transparency Report hub includes transparency reports on requests for user information, government requests to remove content, traffic and disruptions, and many other topics that can potentially impact human rights. Transparency helps our users, the public, regulators, and policymakers understand our policies and our products. Thatâs why weâve created tools like How Search Works , How Play Works , and How YouTube Works to explain how our products operate, and share our approach on specific issues, such as disinformation and information quality .To learn more, please visit the Google Transparency Center . As a founding member of the Global Network Initiative, Google is subject to a periodic assessment by an independent party to review how the company integrates GNI Principles into our governance, due diligence and risk management, and operational practices. The GNI makes these company assessments publicly available . We are committed to constantly improving, and that includes efforts to strengthen our approach to civil and human rights.

Reading mode on Android, a more accessible reading experience designed for and with people with low vision, blindness, and dyslexia. Magnifier , a camera-based app for seeing things with detail up close, designed in collaboration with trusted partners at the Royal National Institute of Blind People and National Federation of the Blind. Sound notifications on Android, a helpful feature that detects and notifies people of critical household sounds, like smoke alarms, doorbells, or crying babies, specifically designed for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Live Transcribe , a no-cost Android service that provides automatic captions in more than 70 languages to help people who are deaf or hard of hearing participate in conversations.

Making technology more accessible in more languages with help from AI (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window Accessibility with AI When we canât experience technology in our language, it limits what we can learn, what jobs we can have, what stories we can share, and so much more. Thatâs why weâre using AI to make the internet and digital tools more accessible and useful for speakers of all languages, all around the world. Here are some of the ways weâre doing it: In 2022, we announced the 1,000 Languages Initiative , an ambitious commitment to build an AI model that will support the 1,000 most spoken languages and bring greater inclusion to billions of people in marginalized communities all around the world. Weâve built a language model for Bambara, one of West Africa's most widely spoken languages, to make the worldâs information more accessible to its speakers. Weâve added support for additional languages across many AI-powered products and features, including Live Caption , Google Translate , and Gemini .

Improving skin tone representation across Google products (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window Skin tone representation Historically, image-based technologies have not been designed for people of all skin tones, leading to subpar experiences for people with darker skin. In 2022, we took steps to address this problem by openly releasing the Monk Skin Tone (MST) Scale , an alternative 10-shade scale developed by professor and sociologist Dr. Ellis Monk thatâs more representative than the current tech industry standard. Weâre now using the MST Scale to develop better face detection, camera, and image editing products, building on advances we introduced in 2021 with Real Tone . The MST Scale is also helping us create more representative search experiences for everyone. For example, when people search the web for images, they now see an option to further refine their results by skin tone â making it easier for every individual to find whatâs useful and relevant to them. Moving forward, the MST Scale will continue to help us build products and features that reflect and serve everyone.

Improving breast cancer screening with AI (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window AI in Mammography AI can help doctors and patients detect diseases earlier, so it has the potential to improve screening for breast cancer â the most common cancer in women worldwide. Weâve partnered with researchers in the U.S. and U.K. to discover how AI can increase the accuracy and efficiency of mammography programmes, reducing the time to diagnosis and improving the patient experience. Weâre also working with Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) in Taiwan to learn whether our AI models can help with early detection of breast cancer using ultrasound.

Making technology more accessible in more languages with help from AI (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window Accessibility with AI When we canât experience technology in our language, it limits what we can learn, what jobs we can have, what stories we can share, and so much more. Thatâs why weâre using AI to make the internet and digital tools more accessible and useful for speakers of all languages, all around the world. Here are some of the ways weâre doing it: In 2022, we announced the 1,000 Languages Initiative , an ambitious commitment to build an AI model that will support the 1,000 most spoken languages and bring greater inclusion to billions of people in marginalized communities all around the world. Weâve built a language model for Bambara, one of West Africa's most widely spoken languages, to make the worldâs information more accessible to its speakers. Weâve added support for additional languages across many AI-powered products and features, including Live Caption , Google Translate , and Gemini .

Improving skin tone representation across Google products (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window Skin tone representation Historically, image-based technologies have not been designed for people of all skin tones, leading to subpar experiences for people with darker skin. In 2022, we took steps to address this problem by openly releasing the Monk Skin Tone (MST) Scale , an alternative 10-shade scale developed by professor and sociologist Dr. Ellis Monk thatâs more representative than the current tech industry standard. Weâre now using the MST Scale to develop better face detection, camera, and image editing products, building on advances we introduced in 2021 with Real Tone . The MST Scale is also helping us create more representative search experiences for everyone. For example, when people search the web for images, they now see an option to further refine their results by skin tone â making it easier for every individual to find whatâs useful and relevant to them. Moving forward, the MST Scale will continue to help us build products and features that reflect and serve everyone.

Here are some of the ways weâre doing it: In 2022, we announced the 1,000 Languages Initiative , an ambitious commitment to build an AI model that will support the 1,000 most spoken languages and bring greater inclusion to billions of people in marginalized communities all around the world. Weâve built a language model for Bambara, one of West Africa's most widely spoken languages, to make the worldâs information more accessible to its speakers. Weâve added support for additional languages across many AI-powered products and features, including Live Caption , Google Translate , and Gemini .

Improving skin tone representation across Google products (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window Skin tone representation Historically, image-based technologies have not been designed for people of all skin tones, leading to subpar experiences for people with darker skin. In 2022, we took steps to address this problem by openly releasing the Monk Skin Tone (MST) Scale , an alternative 10-shade scale developed by professor and sociologist Dr. Ellis Monk thatâs more representative than the current tech industry standard. Weâre now using the MST Scale to develop better face detection, camera, and image editing products, building on advances we introduced in 2021 with Real Tone . The MST Scale is also helping us create more representative search experiences for everyone. For example, when people search the web for images, they now see an option to further refine their results by skin tone â making it easier for every individual to find whatâs useful and relevant to them. Moving forward, the MST Scale will continue to help us build products and features that reflect and serve everyone.

Making technology more accessible in more languages with help from AI (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window Accessibility with AI When we canât experience technology in our language, it limits what we can learn, what jobs we can have, what stories we can share, and so much more. Thatâs why weâre using AI to make the internet and digital tools more accessible and useful for speakers of all languages, all around the world. Here are some of the ways weâre doing it: In 2022, we announced the 1,000 Languages Initiative , an ambitious commitment to build an AI model that will support the 1,000 most spoken languages and bring greater inclusion to billions of people in marginalized communities all around the world. Weâve built a language model for Bambara, one of West Africa's most widely spoken languages, to make the worldâs information more accessible to its speakers. Weâve added support for additional languages across many AI-powered products and features, including Live Caption , Google Translate , and Gemini .

Improving skin tone representation across Google products (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window Skin tone representation Historically, image-based technologies have not been designed for people of all skin tones, leading to subpar experiences for people with darker skin. In 2022, we took steps to address this problem by openly releasing the Monk Skin Tone (MST) Scale , an alternative 10-shade scale developed by professor and sociologist Dr. Ellis Monk thatâs more representative than the current tech industry standard. Weâre now using the MST Scale to develop better face detection, camera, and image editing products, building on advances we introduced in 2021 with Real Tone . The MST Scale is also helping us create more representative search experiences for everyone. For example, when people search the web for images, they now see an option to further refine their results by skin tone â making it easier for every individual to find whatâs useful and relevant to them. Moving forward, the MST Scale will continue to help us build products and features that reflect and serve everyone.

Improving breast cancer screening with AI (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window AI in Mammography AI can help doctors and patients detect diseases earlier, so it has the potential to improve screening for breast cancer â the most common cancer in women worldwide. Weâve partnered with researchers in the U.S. and U.K. to discover how AI can increase the accuracy and efficiency of mammography programmes, reducing the time to diagnosis and improving the patient experience. Weâre also working with Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) in Taiwan to learn whether our AI models can help with early detection of breast cancer using ultrasound. Beyond screening and monitoring, weâre researching ways that AI can support and inform the treatment of breast cancer and other diseases across the globe. For example, weâve partnered with Mayo Clinic to develop an AI system that can help doctors reduce planning time and improve the efficiency of radiotherapy, a common cancer treatment.

Lookout , an Android feature that helps people with visual impairments get descriptions of the physical world using their phone's camera and ask follow-up questions by voice or keyboard. Reading mode on Android, a more accessible reading experience designed for and with people with low vision, blindness, and dyslexia. Magnifier , a camera-based app for seeing things with detail up close, designed in collaboration with trusted partners at the Royal National Institute of Blind People and National Federation of the Blind. Sound notifications on Android, a helpful feature that detects and notifies people of critical household sounds, like smoke alarms, doorbells, or crying babies, specifically designed for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Live Transcribe , a no-cost Android service that provides automatic captions in more than 70 languages to help people who are deaf or hard of hearing participate in conversations. Conversation mode for Pixel phones, which uses on-device machine learning to help anyone better hear conversations in loud environments by tuning out competing noise.

Making technology more accessible in more languages with help from AI (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window Accessibility with AI When we canât experience technology in our language, it limits what we can learn, what jobs we can have, what stories we can share, and so much more. Thatâs why weâre using AI to make the internet and digital tools more accessible and useful for speakers of all languages, all around the world. Here are some of the ways weâre doing it: In 2022, we announced the 1,000 Languages Initiative , an ambitious commitment to build an AI model that will support the 1,000 most spoken languages and bring greater inclusion to billions of people in marginalized communities all around the world. Weâve built a language model for Bambara, one of West Africa's most widely spoken languages, to make the worldâs information more accessible to its speakers. Weâve added support for additional languages across many AI-powered products and features, including Live Caption , Google Translate , and Gemini .

Improving skin tone representation across Google products (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window Skin tone representation Historically, image-based technologies have not been designed for people of all skin tones, leading to subpar experiences for people with darker skin. In 2022, we took steps to address this problem by openly releasing the Monk Skin Tone (MST) Scale , an alternative 10-shade scale developed by professor and sociologist Dr. Ellis Monk thatâs more representative than the current tech industry standard. Weâre now using the MST Scale to develop better face detection, camera, and image editing products, building on advances we introduced in 2021 with Real Tone . The MST Scale is also helping us create more representative search experiences for everyone. For example, when people search the web for images, they now see an option to further refine their results by skin tone â making it easier for every individual to find whatâs useful and relevant to them. Moving forward, the MST Scale will continue to help us build products and features that reflect and serve everyone.

Improving breast cancer screening with AI (Opens in a Dialog Window) Close dialog window AI in Mammography AI can help doctors and patients detect diseases earlier, so it has the potential to improve screening for breast cancer â the most common cancer in women worldwide. Weâve partnered with researchers in the U.S. and U.K. to discover how AI can increase the accuracy and efficiency of mammography programmes, reducing the time to diagnosis and improving the patient experience. Weâre also working with Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) in Taiwan to learn whether our AI models can help with early detection of breast cancer using ultrasound. Beyond screening and monitoring, weâre researching ways that AI can support and inform the treatment of breast cancer and other diseases across the globe. For example, weâve partnered with Mayo Clinic to develop an AI system that can help doctors reduce planning time and improve the efficiency of radiotherapy, a common cancer treatment.

And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results . For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like. Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center . We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories , such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos. We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop. Go to My Ad Center Measure performance We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services. Communicate with you We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing. Protect Google, our users, and the public We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public . We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate. We may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google. If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example. We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy. Your privacy controls You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup , which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide . Go to Privacy Checkup Managing, reviewing, and updating your information When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google. We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes: Privacy controls Activity Controls Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services , such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services. Go to Activity Controls Ad settings Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly , for things like remembering your language preferences. Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device. Sharing your information When you share your information Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search. When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting . When Google shares your information We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases: With your consent We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information . With domain administrators If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings For external processing We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: Respond to any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request . We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report . Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users , or the public. We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies. If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Keeping your information secure We build security into our services to protect your information All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected. We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including: We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing , Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations. Exporting & deleting your information You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs. We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services. And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping. When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems. You can read more about Google’s data retention periods , including how long it takes us to delete your information. Compliance & cooperation with regulators We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it. Data transfers We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data. When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies . On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services. Additional Context Activity on Google Services If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy. In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search.

Learn more payment information For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this. We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more personalized ads You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more phone number If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more Places you label like home and work You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for more useful ads. You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account. protect against abuse For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account). publicly accessible sources For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services. rely on cookies to function properly For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more safety and reliability Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include: Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn more sensitive categories When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like ""Cooking and Recipes"" or ""Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services. Sensor data from your device Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.

Voice and audio information For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation.

Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches.

How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet.

Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to.

Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves?

Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long.

Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves?

Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information.

We collect information we need in order to provide our services, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Ways we use data. For example, Google Maps can help you get to where youâre going while avoiding traffic because it combines information about where you are (your data) with public data (maps and information about public places). Ways we use data Provide our services We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results. Maintain & improve our services Data helps us maintain and improve our services. For example, we can track outages.

Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves?

Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to.

Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information. Access by school admins Your school admin may be able to access the following information in your Google Workspace for Education account: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings Why Google might share your info When you give us permission For example, if you use Google Assistant to order a pizza, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. See How Google helps you share data safely with third-party apps & services With domain administrators , as described above. For external processing , We provide personal information to companies we work with to process data based on instructions we give them. For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information.

Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company.

Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information. Access by school admins Your school admin may be able to access the following information in your Google Workspace for Education account: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings Why Google might share your info When you give us permission For example, if you use Google Assistant to order a pizza, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. See How Google helps you share data safely with third-party apps & services With domain administrators , as described above. For external processing , We provide personal information to companies we work with to process data based on instructions we give them. For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. Back to topics Data & personalization What data does Google collect about me? What is data? Why does Google collect data? How does Google use data to personalize things? Does Google personalize the ads I see? What data does Google collect about me? When you use Google services, we collect information we need in order to provide them to you, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Why does Google collect data? . With your settings, you can limit the data we collect and how that data is used. For example, if you donât want us to save your YouTube History to your Google Account, you can turn YouTube History off. See How can I decide what Google saves? What is data? Your personal information includes things you provide to us which personally identify you, such as your name or email address. It also includes other data that can be reasonably linked to you by Google, such as information we associate with you in your Google Account. Your personal information includes two types of things: Things you provide or create When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information like your name and a password. You can also save content you create, upload, or receive from others, like email messages, and photos. Things you do on Google We collect information about your activity in our services, which can include things like the terms you search for and the videos you watch, people with whom you communicate or share content, and your Chrome browsing history to deliver a better experience. We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like dimming your screen if your battery runs low. We process your location, such as when youâre using features like turn-by-turn directions. For more, see the Location section. Why does Google collect data? We collect information we need in order to provide our services, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Ways we use data. For example, Google Maps can help you get to where youâre going while avoiding traffic because it combines information about where you are (your data) with public data (maps and information about public places). Ways we use data Provide our services We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results. Maintain & improve our services Data helps us maintain and improve our services. For example, we can track outages. And understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services Data helps us develop new services.

And we may use your interactions with our services, including our generative AI products, to develop and improve these services. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use data to provide personalized content, for example, recommendations for videos you may like. Depending on your settings and how old you are, we may show you personalized ads based on your interests. Measure performance We also use data to measure performance and understand how our services are used Communicate with you We might use your email address to send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity Protect Google, our users, and the public We use data to keep people safer online, like detecting and preventing fraud How does Google use data to personalize things? âPersonalizationâ is about using the information we collect to tailor our apps and sites to you, for example: Recommendations for videos you may like Security tips adapted to how you use Google services (see Security Checkup ) We also use data to personalize ads except in cases like when the setting is off or for certain ages. Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves? How do I delete my activity data? How do I download my content? What controls do I have when Iâm signed out? How can I decide what Google saves to my account?

https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/teens/?hl=en_US#how_can_I_decide_what_google_saves_ans,"Privacy Facts for Teens : Teen Privacy Guide Jump to Content Teen Privacy Guide Teen Privacy Guide Your privacy on Google Here's where you can find answers to some of the top questions we get asked about privacy, like What is data ? Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information. Access by school admins Your school admin may be able to access the following information in your Google Workspace for Education account: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings Why Google might share your info When you give us permission For example, if you use Google Assistant to order a pizza, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. See How Google helps you share data safely with third-party apps & services With domain administrators , as described above. For external processing , We provide personal information to companies we work with to process data based on instructions we give them. For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. Back to topics Data & personalization What data does Google collect about me? What is data? Why does Google collect data? How does Google use data to personalize things? Does Google personalize the ads I see? What data does Google collect about me? When you use Google services, we collect information we need in order to provide them to you, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Why does Google collect data? . With your settings, you can limit the data we collect and how that data is used. For example, if you donât want us to save your YouTube History to your Google Account, you can turn YouTube History off. See How can I decide what Google saves? What is data? Your personal information includes things you provide to us which personally identify you, such as your name or email address. It also includes other data that can be reasonably linked to you by Google, such as information we associate with you in your Google Account. Your personal information includes two types of things: Things you provide or create When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information like your name and a password. You can also save content you create, upload, or receive from others, like email messages, and photos. Things you do on Google We collect information about your activity in our services, which can include things like the terms you search for and the videos you watch, people with whom you communicate or share content, and your Chrome browsing history to deliver a better experience. We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like dimming your screen if your battery runs low. We process your location, such as when youâre using features like turn-by-turn directions. For more, see the Location section. Why does Google collect data? We collect information we need in order to provide our services, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Ways we use data. For example, Google Maps can help you get to where youâre going while avoiding traffic because it combines information about where you are (your data) with public data (maps and information about public places). Ways we use data Provide our services We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results. Maintain & improve our services Data helps us maintain and improve our services. For example, we can track outages. And understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services Data helps us develop new services. For example, we were able to understand how people organized their photos in our first photos app, Picasa, and used that data to help design and launch Google Photos. And we may use your interactions with our services, including our generative AI products, to develop and improve these services. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use data to provide personalized content, for example, recommendations for videos you may like. Depending on your settings and how old you are, we may show you personalized ads based on your interests. Measure performance We also use data to measure performance and understand how our services are used Communicate with you We might use your email address to send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity Protect Google, our users, and the public We use data to keep people safer online, like detecting and preventing fraud How does Google use data to personalize things? âPersonalizationâ is about using the information we collect to tailor our apps and sites to you, for example: Recommendations for videos you may like Security tips adapted to how you use Google services (see Security Checkup ) We also use data to personalize ads except in cases like when the setting is off or for certain ages. Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves? How do I delete my activity data? How do I download my content? What controls do I have when Iâm signed out? How can I decide what Google saves to my account?

Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information. Access by school admins Your school admin may be able to access the following information in your Google Workspace for Education account: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings Why Google might share your info When you give us permission For example, if you use Google Assistant to order a pizza, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. See How Google helps you share data safely with third-party apps & services With domain administrators , as described above. For external processing , We provide personal information to companies we work with to process data based on instructions we give them. For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. Back to topics Data & personalization What data does Google collect about me? What is data? Why does Google collect data? How does Google use data to personalize things? Does Google personalize the ads I see? What data does Google collect about me? When you use Google services, we collect information we need in order to provide them to you, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Why does Google collect data? . With your settings, you can limit the data we collect and how that data is used. For example, if you donât want us to save your YouTube History to your Google Account, you can turn YouTube History off. See How can I decide what Google saves? What is data? Your personal information includes things you provide to us which personally identify you, such as your name or email address. It also includes other data that can be reasonably linked to you by Google, such as information we associate with you in your Google Account. Your personal information includes two types of things: Things you provide or create When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information like your name and a password. You can also save content you create, upload, or receive from others, like email messages, and photos. Things you do on Google We collect information about your activity in our services, which can include things like the terms you search for and the videos you watch, people with whom you communicate or share content, and your Chrome browsing history to deliver a better experience. We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like dimming your screen if your battery runs low. We process your location, such as when youâre using features like turn-by-turn directions. For more, see the Location section. Why does Google collect data? We collect information we need in order to provide our services, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Ways we use data. For example, Google Maps can help you get to where youâre going while avoiding traffic because it combines information about where you are (your data) with public data (maps and information about public places). Ways we use data Provide our services We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results. Maintain & improve our services Data helps us maintain and improve our services. For example, we can track outages. And understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services Data helps us develop new services.

And we may use your interactions with our services, including our generative AI products, to develop and improve these services. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use data to provide personalized content, for example, recommendations for videos you may like. Depending on your settings and how old you are, we may show you personalized ads based on your interests. Measure performance We also use data to measure performance and understand how our services are used Communicate with you We might use your email address to send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity Protect Google, our users, and the public We use data to keep people safer online, like detecting and preventing fraud How does Google use data to personalize things? âPersonalizationâ is about using the information we collect to tailor our apps and sites to you, for example: Recommendations for videos you may like Security tips adapted to how you use Google services (see Security Checkup ) We also use data to personalize ads except in cases like when the setting is off or for certain ages. Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves? How do I delete my activity data? How do I download my content? What controls do I have when Iâm signed out? How can I decide what Google saves to my account?

https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/teens/?hl=en_US#data_and_personalization,"Privacy Facts for Teens : Teen Privacy Guide Jump to Content Teen Privacy Guide Teen Privacy Guide Your privacy on Google Here's where you can find answers to some of the top questions we get asked about privacy, like What is data ? Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information. Access by school admins Your school admin may be able to access the following information in your Google Workspace for Education account: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings Why Google might share your info When you give us permission For example, if you use Google Assistant to order a pizza, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. See How Google helps you share data safely with third-party apps & services With domain administrators , as described above. For external processing , We provide personal information to companies we work with to process data based on instructions we give them. For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. Back to topics Data & personalization What data does Google collect about me? What is data? Why does Google collect data? How does Google use data to personalize things? Does Google personalize the ads I see? What data does Google collect about me? When you use Google services, we collect information we need in order to provide them to you, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Why does Google collect data? . With your settings, you can limit the data we collect and how that data is used. For example, if you donât want us to save your YouTube History to your Google Account, you can turn YouTube History off. See How can I decide what Google saves? What is data? Your personal information includes things you provide to us which personally identify you, such as your name or email address. It also includes other data that can be reasonably linked to you by Google, such as information we associate with you in your Google Account. Your personal information includes two types of things: Things you provide or create When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information like your name and a password. You can also save content you create, upload, or receive from others, like email messages, and photos. Things you do on Google We collect information about your activity in our services, which can include things like the terms you search for and the videos you watch, people with whom you communicate or share content, and your Chrome browsing history to deliver a better experience. We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like dimming your screen if your battery runs low. We process your location, such as when youâre using features like turn-by-turn directions. For more, see the Location section. Why does Google collect data? We collect information we need in order to provide our services, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Ways we use data. For example, Google Maps can help you get to where youâre going while avoiding traffic because it combines information about where you are (your data) with public data (maps and information about public places). Ways we use data Provide our services We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results. Maintain & improve our services Data helps us maintain and improve our services. For example, we can track outages. And understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services Data helps us develop new services. For example, we were able to understand how people organized their photos in our first photos app, Picasa, and used that data to help design and launch Google Photos. And we may use your interactions with our services, including our generative AI products, to develop and improve these services. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use data to provide personalized content, for example, recommendations for videos you may like. Depending on your settings and how old you are, we may show you personalized ads based on your interests. Measure performance We also use data to measure performance and understand how our services are used Communicate with you We might use your email address to send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity Protect Google, our users, and the public We use data to keep people safer online, like detecting and preventing fraud How does Google use data to personalize things? âPersonalizationâ is about using the information we collect to tailor our apps and sites to you, for example: Recommendations for videos you may like Security tips adapted to how you use Google services (see Security Checkup ) We also use data to personalize ads except in cases like when the setting is off or for certain ages. Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves? How do I delete my activity data? How do I download my content? What controls do I have when Iâm signed out? How can I decide what Google saves to my account?

https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/teens/,"Privacy Facts for Teens : Teen Privacy Guide Jump to Content Teen Privacy Guide Teen Privacy Guide Your privacy on Google Here's where you can find answers to some of the top questions we get asked about privacy, like What is data ? Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information. Access by school admins Your school admin may be able to access the following information in your Google Workspace for Education account: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings Why Google might share your info When you give us permission For example, if you use Google Assistant to order a pizza, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. See How Google helps you share data safely with third-party apps & services With domain administrators , as described above. For external processing , We provide personal information to companies we work with to process data based on instructions we give them. For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. Back to topics Data & personalization What data does Google collect about me? What is data? Why does Google collect data? How does Google use data to personalize things? Does Google personalize the ads I see? What data does Google collect about me? When you use Google services, we collect information we need in order to provide them to you, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Why does Google collect data? . With your settings, you can limit the data we collect and how that data is used. For example, if you donât want us to save your YouTube History to your Google Account, you can turn YouTube History off. See How can I decide what Google saves? What is data? Your personal information includes things you provide to us which personally identify you, such as your name or email address. It also includes other data that can be reasonably linked to you by Google, such as information we associate with you in your Google Account. Your personal information includes two types of things: Things you provide or create When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information like your name and a password. You can also save content you create, upload, or receive from others, like email messages, and photos. Things you do on Google We collect information about your activity in our services, which can include things like the terms you search for and the videos you watch, people with whom you communicate or share content, and your Chrome browsing history to deliver a better experience. We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like dimming your screen if your battery runs low. We process your location, such as when youâre using features like turn-by-turn directions. For more, see the Location section. Why does Google collect data? We collect information we need in order to provide our services, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Ways we use data. For example, Google Maps can help you get to where youâre going while avoiding traffic because it combines information about where you are (your data) with public data (maps and information about public places). Ways we use data Provide our services We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results. Maintain & improve our services Data helps us maintain and improve our services. For example, we can track outages. And understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services Data helps us develop new services. For example, we were able to understand how people organized their photos in our first photos app, Picasa, and used that data to help design and launch Google Photos. And we may use your interactions with our services, including our generative AI products, to develop and improve these services. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use data to provide personalized content, for example, recommendations for videos you may like. Depending on your settings and how old you are, we may show you personalized ads based on your interests. Measure performance We also use data to measure performance and understand how our services are used Communicate with you We might use your email address to send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity Protect Google, our users, and the public We use data to keep people safer online, like detecting and preventing fraud How does Google use data to personalize things? âPersonalizationâ is about using the information we collect to tailor our apps and sites to you, for example: Recommendations for videos you may like Security tips adapted to how you use Google services (see Security Checkup ) We also use data to personalize ads except in cases like when the setting is off or for certain ages. Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves? How do I delete my activity data? How do I download my content? What controls do I have when Iâm signed out? How can I decide what Google saves to my account?

https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/teens/#what_is_data_ans,"Privacy Facts for Teens : Teen Privacy Guide Jump to Content Teen Privacy Guide Teen Privacy Guide Your privacy on Google Here's where you can find answers to some of the top questions we get asked about privacy, like What is data ? Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information. Access by school admins Your school admin may be able to access the following information in your Google Workspace for Education account: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings Why Google might share your info When you give us permission For example, if you use Google Assistant to order a pizza, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. See How Google helps you share data safely with third-party apps & services With domain administrators , as described above. For external processing , We provide personal information to companies we work with to process data based on instructions we give them. For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. Back to topics Data & personalization What data does Google collect about me? What is data? Why does Google collect data? How does Google use data to personalize things? Does Google personalize the ads I see? What data does Google collect about me? When you use Google services, we collect information we need in order to provide them to you, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Why does Google collect data? . With your settings, you can limit the data we collect and how that data is used. For example, if you donât want us to save your YouTube History to your Google Account, you can turn YouTube History off. See How can I decide what Google saves? What is data? Your personal information includes things you provide to us which personally identify you, such as your name or email address. It also includes other data that can be reasonably linked to you by Google, such as information we associate with you in your Google Account. Your personal information includes two types of things: Things you provide or create When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information like your name and a password. You can also save content you create, upload, or receive from others, like email messages, and photos. Things you do on Google We collect information about your activity in our services, which can include things like the terms you search for and the videos you watch, people with whom you communicate or share content, and your Chrome browsing history to deliver a better experience. We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like dimming your screen if your battery runs low. We process your location, such as when youâre using features like turn-by-turn directions. For more, see the Location section. Why does Google collect data? We collect information we need in order to provide our services, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Ways we use data. For example, Google Maps can help you get to where youâre going while avoiding traffic because it combines information about where you are (your data) with public data (maps and information about public places). Ways we use data Provide our services We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results. Maintain & improve our services Data helps us maintain and improve our services. For example, we can track outages. And understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services Data helps us develop new services. For example, we were able to understand how people organized their photos in our first photos app, Picasa, and used that data to help design and launch Google Photos. And we may use your interactions with our services, including our generative AI products, to develop and improve these services. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use data to provide personalized content, for example, recommendations for videos you may like. Depending on your settings and how old you are, we may show you personalized ads based on your interests. Measure performance We also use data to measure performance and understand how our services are used Communicate with you We might use your email address to send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity Protect Google, our users, and the public We use data to keep people safer online, like detecting and preventing fraud How does Google use data to personalize things? âPersonalizationâ is about using the information we collect to tailor our apps and sites to you, for example: Recommendations for videos you may like Security tips adapted to how you use Google services (see Security Checkup ) We also use data to personalize ads except in cases like when the setting is off or for certain ages. Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves? How do I delete my activity data? How do I download my content? What controls do I have when Iâm signed out? How can I decide what Google saves to my account?

https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/teens/#who_can_see_my_location_ans,"Privacy Facts for Teens : Teen Privacy Guide Jump to Content Teen Privacy Guide Teen Privacy Guide Your privacy on Google Here's where you can find answers to some of the top questions we get asked about privacy, like What is data ? Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information. Access by school admins Your school admin may be able to access the following information in your Google Workspace for Education account: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings Why Google might share your info When you give us permission For example, if you use Google Assistant to order a pizza, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. See How Google helps you share data safely with third-party apps & services With domain administrators , as described above. For external processing , We provide personal information to companies we work with to process data based on instructions we give them. For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. Back to topics Data & personalization What data does Google collect about me? What is data? Why does Google collect data? How does Google use data to personalize things? Does Google personalize the ads I see? What data does Google collect about me? When you use Google services, we collect information we need in order to provide them to you, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Why does Google collect data? . With your settings, you can limit the data we collect and how that data is used. For example, if you donât want us to save your YouTube History to your Google Account, you can turn YouTube History off. See How can I decide what Google saves? What is data? Your personal information includes things you provide to us which personally identify you, such as your name or email address. It also includes other data that can be reasonably linked to you by Google, such as information we associate with you in your Google Account. Your personal information includes two types of things: Things you provide or create When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information like your name and a password. You can also save content you create, upload, or receive from others, like email messages, and photos. Things you do on Google We collect information about your activity in our services, which can include things like the terms you search for and the videos you watch, people with whom you communicate or share content, and your Chrome browsing history to deliver a better experience. We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like dimming your screen if your battery runs low. We process your location, such as when youâre using features like turn-by-turn directions. For more, see the Location section. Why does Google collect data? We collect information we need in order to provide our services, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Ways we use data. For example, Google Maps can help you get to where youâre going while avoiding traffic because it combines information about where you are (your data) with public data (maps and information about public places). Ways we use data Provide our services We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results. Maintain & improve our services Data helps us maintain and improve our services. For example, we can track outages. And understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services Data helps us develop new services. For example, we were able to understand how people organized their photos in our first photos app, Picasa, and used that data to help design and launch Google Photos. And we may use your interactions with our services, including our generative AI products, to develop and improve these services. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use data to provide personalized content, for example, recommendations for videos you may like. Depending on your settings and how old you are, we may show you personalized ads based on your interests. Measure performance We also use data to measure performance and understand how our services are used Communicate with you We might use your email address to send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity Protect Google, our users, and the public We use data to keep people safer online, like detecting and preventing fraud How does Google use data to personalize things? âPersonalizationâ is about using the information we collect to tailor our apps and sites to you, for example: Recommendations for videos you may like Security tips adapted to how you use Google services (see Security Checkup ) We also use data to personalize ads except in cases like when the setting is off or for certain ages. Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves? How do I delete my activity data? How do I download my content? What controls do I have when Iâm signed out? How can I decide what Google saves to my account?

Also have a look at the Privacy Policy if you want to learn more. Your location Go to topic Sharing on Google Go to topic Data & personalization Go to topic Youâre in control Go to topic Your location Does Google know my location? How can I turn location on and off? How precise is my location? How does Google know my location? Who can see my location? Does Google know my location? Whenever you use the internet, apps and sites can estimate roughly where you are, and the same is true for Google. Google may also know your precise location, depending on your device settings. (See How precise is my location? ) When you search on Google, like with Search, Maps, or Google Assistant, your current location may be used to give you more helpful results. For example, if you search for restaurants, the most helpful results are probably for restaurants near where you are. See How you can manage your location How can I turn location on and off? When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. Google, like any app or website you use that connects to the Internet, can estimate your location based on your deviceâs IP address. For more, see How does Google know where I am? To choose whether to send your precise location when you use Google, you can turn location permissions on or off for individual apps, sites, and for your device. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that youâre at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search. How precise is my location? Your general area When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that youâre searching from. This way Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 3 sq km and has at least 1,000 users so that the general area of your search doesnât identify you, helping to protect your privacy. Your precise location If you give your permission, Google can use your precise location. For example, Google needs your precise location to return the most relevant results for searches like âice cream near meâ or turn-by-turn walking directions to a store. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. How does Google know my location? Your location comes from different sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. Your deviceâs IP address IP addresses are roughly based on geography, similar to phone number area codes. This means that any app or website you use, including google.com, can estimate the general area youâre in because of your IP address. Your deviceâs IP address is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider, and is required to use the internet. Learn more Your device location If you give a Google app or site permission to use your deviceâs location, that information can be used to help understand where you are. Nearly all devices have a location setting built into the operating system, usually in settings. Learn more Your activity on Google Google can estimate the general area youâre in based on your previous Google searches. For example, if you often search for pizza in Mumbai, itâs likely that you want to see results in Mumbai. Learn more Your labeled places If you set your home or work address, Google can use them to estimate where you are. For example, if you set your home address, and your IP address, previous activity, or other sources of location information suggest that you may be near your home, then we will use your home location as an estimate of where you are. Learn more Who can see my location? Itâs up to you. If you use Google Location Sharing, you can share your real-time location with friends and family across Google services. Check if youâre sharing your location Location Sharing is off by default. If you want to share your real-time location, you need to choose and confirm who you want to share with and for how long. You can stop sharing your location at any time. See Sharing your real-time location with others Back to topics Sharing on Google What can other people see when I share on Google? Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? Does Google ever share my info with others? What can other people see when I share on Google? What other people can see about you on Google services depends on what and how you share: Sharing publicly If you contribute to apps like Google Maps, other people can see your name and picture. For example, if you rate your favorite ice cream store, other people can see your rating, name, and picture if they explore that store on Google Maps. Sharing privately If you share things like photos, videos, and docs with others, your name and picture are visible to the person youâre sending them to in addition to what youâre sharing. Think carefully before sharing with others, and understand what level of access you're giving. For example, when sharing access to things like folders in Google Drive , or albums in Google Photos , people may have continued access as you add new content. Who can see the things I share, such as photos, videos, and docs? You can choose to share specific content with other people in the Google services that you use. Donât forget that when you share, itâs possible for other people to reshare, even in apps and on sites outside of Google. You can delete your own content from your account anytime, but this doesnât delete copies that youâve already shared. Be thoughtful about what you share, and share only with people you trust. Does Google ever share my personal info with others? We donât share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in limited cases like when weâre legally required to. If you have a Google Account through your school (a Google Workspace for Education account), the school administrator who manages your account will have access to your information. Access by school admins Your school admin may be able to access the following information in your Google Workspace for Education account: Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install Change your account password Suspend or terminate your account access Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings Why Google might share your info When you give us permission For example, if you use Google Assistant to order a pizza, weâll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. See How Google helps you share data safely with third-party apps & services With domain administrators , as described above. For external processing , We provide personal information to companies we work with to process data based on instructions we give them. For example, we use external companies to help us with customer support, and have to share personal information with the company in order to respond to user questions. For legal reasons We will share personal information outside of Google if we believe that providing it may be necessary to: Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. Back to topics Data & personalization What data does Google collect about me? What is data? Why does Google collect data? How does Google use data to personalize things? Does Google personalize the ads I see? What data does Google collect about me? When you use Google services, we collect information we need in order to provide them to you, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Why does Google collect data? . With your settings, you can limit the data we collect and how that data is used. For example, if you donât want us to save your YouTube History to your Google Account, you can turn YouTube History off. See How can I decide what Google saves? What is data? Your personal information includes things you provide to us which personally identify you, such as your name or email address. It also includes other data that can be reasonably linked to you by Google, such as information we associate with you in your Google Account. Your personal information includes two types of things: Things you provide or create When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information like your name and a password. You can also save content you create, upload, or receive from others, like email messages, and photos. Things you do on Google We collect information about your activity in our services, which can include things like the terms you search for and the videos you watch, people with whom you communicate or share content, and your Chrome browsing history to deliver a better experience. We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like dimming your screen if your battery runs low. We process your location, such as when youâre using features like turn-by-turn directions. For more, see the Location section. Why does Google collect data? We collect information we need in order to provide our services, make them more useful to you, and for other reasons as explained in Ways we use data. For example, Google Maps can help you get to where youâre going while avoiding traffic because it combines information about where you are (your data) with public data (maps and information about public places). Ways we use data Provide our services We use data to provide our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results. Maintain & improve our services Data helps us maintain and improve our services. For example, we can track outages. And understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services Data helps us develop new services. For example, we were able to understand how people organized their photos in our first photos app, Picasa, and used that data to help design and launch Google Photos. And we may use your interactions with our services, including our generative AI products, to develop and improve these services. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use data to provide personalized content, for example, recommendations for videos you may like. Depending on your settings and how old you are, we may show you personalized ads based on your interests. Measure performance We also use data to measure performance and understand how our services are used Communicate with you We might use your email address to send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity Protect Google, our users, and the public We use data to keep people safer online, like detecting and preventing fraud How does Google use data to personalize things? âPersonalizationâ is about using the information we collect to tailor our apps and sites to you, for example: Recommendations for videos you may like Security tips adapted to how you use Google services (see Security Checkup ) We also use data to personalize ads except in cases like when the setting is off or for certain ages. Does Google personalize the ads I see? We try to make the ads we show as useful as possible. But we donât personalize ads for certain ages or for people who turn Ad personalization off. We can still make ads useful even without personalizing them. For example, if youâre looking at a page of results for ânew shoes,â you might see an ad from a sneaker company. The ad can be based on general factors like the time of day, your general location, and content of the page youâre looking at. Back to topics Youâre in control How can I decide what Google saves? How do I delete my activity data? How do I download my content? What controls do I have when Iâm signed out? How can I decide what Google saves to my account?
